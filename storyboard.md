Learning to trade Gold Futures






## 🧠 Midas Touch

Learning to trade Gold Futures

#### King Midas

King Midas was a legendary king granted a wish that everything he touched would turn to gold.
At first delighted, he soon realized the gift was a curse when food, drink, and even his daughter turned to gold.
The myth serves as a warning about greed and the unintended consequences of valuing wealth over human life.

## 🟡 Top Data Points for Evaluating Gold Futures

1. **Spot Gold Price** — The current cash market price of gold, which anchors futures contracts and reflects immediate supply and demand.
2. **Futures Curve (Contango/Backwardation)** — Shows how future delivery prices compare to spot, indicating storage costs, interest rates, and market expectations.
3. **U.S. Dollar Index (DXY)** — Gold is priced in dollars, so a stronger dollar usually puts downward pressure on gold prices.
4. **Real Interest Rates** — Rising real yields make non-yielding assets like gold less attractive, while falling real rates support higher gold prices.
5. **Inflation Expectations** — Gold often rises when investors expect inflation to erode the purchasing power of fiat currencies.
6. **Central Bank Gold Purchases** — Large-scale buying or selling by central banks significantly affects global demand and long-term price trends.
7. **COMEX Open Interest** — Measures how many gold futures contracts are active, signaling speculative and hedging interest in the market.
8. **ETF Gold Holdings (e.g., GLD)** — Inflows and outflows from gold ETFs reflect institutional and retail investor sentiment toward gold.
9. **Geopolitical Risk Index** — Wars, sanctions, and global instability increase safe-haven demand for gold.
10. **Mining Supply and Production Costs** — Changes in gold output and extraction costs affect long-term supply and price floors.

## What are gold ETF's 

Gold ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) are investment funds that let you buy and sell exposure to the price of gold on the stock market without having to physically own or store gold.

They work by either holding physical gold in vaults (like GLD or IAU) or by holding gold futures contracts, and each share represents a fractional claim on that gold or its price movement.
Gold ETFs make it easy for investors to trade gold like a stock, use it for inflation protection, portfolio diversification, or as a safe-haven asset during economic uncertainty.
